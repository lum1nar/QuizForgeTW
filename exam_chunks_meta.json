Although that is enough to keep most people away from those animals, one part of them that has been received with open arms is their fins. The Chinese eat it in the way of a soup, which they say has many things that are good for people’s health. The dish has even grown to become a sign of wealth and class for them.\nFor many others, shark fin soup is mean and not needed. The reason for that is how the shark fin is taken. It is called shark-finning, and it cuts the fins off living sharks before throwing them back into the ocean. There, they not only lose blood and die, but they also become food for other sea animals. Shark-finning is threatening the sharks and the oceans because the animals grow slowly and some types are already dying off. Millions of these sea animals die every year, which throws everything off balance.\nLucky for us, governments across the planet have taken action to try to fix this problem. In 2000, the USA made shark-finning illegal. Also, Palau, the Maldives, and the Bahamas have set up natural places that are safe for sharks. Thanks to those actions and others, people have become more aware. More people who are getting married don’t have shark fin soup at their weddings. Also, some restaurants have taken the dish off their menus.\n\n29. How do people feel about shark fin soup?\n(A) The Chinese think it’s a sign of being rich.\n(B) Americans love how the fins are taken.\n(C) Everybody knows it’s good for your health.\n(D) Nobody wants it to be taken off the menu.\n30. What does something being “feared” mean?\n(A) It makes people feel nothing.\n(B) That thing is really wanted.",

The reason for that is I’ve been busy seeing the sights and having the time of my life. This is the first chance I’ve gotten to sit down and check my e-mails.\nAnyway, it’s time that you catch up on what I’ve been up to since I checked in at my hotel on Monday. Yesterday, I got up early because I planned to walk across the Brooklyn Bridge, check out Wall Street, and then visit the 911 Memorial. When I got to the bridge, it was blocked off because a group of people were filming a movie. I moved closer to see if I knew anybody. You’re not going to believe this, but I saw my favorite actor, Tom Hanks, acting there. I tried to take a picture of him, but a guard stopped me before I could. He told me I could stay around and watch as long as I kept quiet and didn’t try that again. Though it was interesting, I decided to leave and finish what I set out to do. The day before that, I spent most of my time exploring Central Park and some of the museums around there. Also, on the first morning, I headed straight for the Empire State Building and then Times Square because I was dying to see them.\nThere’s too much to share in one e-mail, so I’ll tell you more next time. The city is calling my name, and I must not keep it waiting.\nYour friend,\nStephanie\n\n film  guard  explore  dying to \n32. Why does Stephanie write the letter?\n(A) To invite Mavis over.\n(B) To share news about her trip.\n(C) To let Mavis know how New York City looks.\n(D) To answer Mavis’s question.\n33.

I read in the paper today that close to seven million people were affected.\nKen: I learned from the news this morning that this was all because someone at the power company made the mistake of turning something important off for a few minutes. By the time they noticed it, six of the machines that make the power already stopped working.\nCindy: Yeah, and I heard that the fire department got over one hundred calls about people who couldn’t get out of elevators. It sounds scary! I had that kind of experience before. I was stuck in the elevator for about one and a half hours, and it was the worst experience I’ve ever had.\nKen: If you think that’s bad, how about the people down in the metro or high up in the air in the cable cars?

We want to read them every day, but we can’t. We have tests, and we can only read your storybooks on weekends. Some words in the books are hard for us, but we really love reading them. We can learn new words from the books. The stories are so great, and we have a lot of thoughts about them. Our favorite story is The Quiet Museum. Do you like it, too?\nBy the way, do you remember our pet dog, Lucky? He can listen to us and sit down or stand up now. He can catch a ball, too. Isn’t he cool? Please come to see Lucky and us next year. We miss you!\nNick and Tom\n\n12 ( ) What can we say about Nick and Tom?\n(A) They don’t have any pets at home.\n(B) Every word in the books is hard for them.\n(C) They don’t want to see Uncle Danny.\n(D) They read English books on weekends.",

The company’s website became one of the 50 most‑visited in the world this year.\nPeople can ask the chatbot a question, and it will reply with an answer in essay form. Students and teachers are considering the effects of this on schools.\nSome school districts have banned ChatGPT. Some teachers see it as a tool that can be used to cheat. However, many educators say it’s too late to keep AI out of their classrooms. Some think ChatGPT is to English and writing what the calculator is to math. Some teachers said ChatGPT helped them come up with creative ideas for classes and to simplify texts for students not fluent in English.\nChatGPT’s answers are not always right. Text generated by ChatGPT often contains factual errors, can be in the wrong format, or the tone can be off. What’s more, it may contain biases from the data it uses. For example, the views, knowledge, and experiences of smaller communities are less represented.\nSome say those with access to a high‑speed Internet connection will be able to use AI consistently, but many students do not have that access. So allowing the use of AI for schoolwork could also lead to an unfair situation that will benefit some students over others.\n\n49. What is ChatGPT?\n(A) A chatbot.\n(B) A smartphone.\n(C) A teacher.\n(D) A student.\n\n50. Why have some school districts banned ChatGPT?\n(A) It makes homework too difficult for students.\n(B) Students would spend all their time reading.\n(C) Students could use it to cheat.\n(D) Teachers don’t know how to use it.\n\n51. Which of the following might be an example of \"biases\"?\n(A) Not all women like to go shopping.\n(B) Men and women can do many of the same things.\n(C) Not all men like to watch sports.\n(D) Men should make more money than women for doing the same work.",

However, it is different from any libraries you know. It is a secret underground library, and only people in Darayya know where it is.\nOver the years, war has shaken Darayya badly. Every day, houses are bombed and people are killed.\nStores are closed one after another, and schools are, too. To help the kids in Darayya with their learning, Anas Ahmad, a 19-year‑year-old student, and his friends decided to build a library. They built the library under the ground to keep it safe from bombing. But it is dangerous to collect books for the library. Often, Ahmad and his friends look for books in houses that were bombed. They need to be careful because they may be killed in another bombing.\nYou may ask, “In a place like Darayya, would people be interested in books?” “Just like the body needs food, the mind needs books,” says one library user. In the library, people enjoy their time of reading and forget about the terrible world above. Through reading, they are able to dream of a better life after war.\n\n( )19. Below are the ideas that are talked about in the reading.\na. The problems Darayya has.\nb. How Darayya’s library was started.\nc. What makes Darayya’s library special.\nd. How Darayya’s library helps people there.\nIn what order does the writer put his ideas in the reading?\n(A) c → b → a → d (B) b → a → d → c. (C) a → c → b → d. (D) c → a → b → d.\n\n( )20. Why do people in Darayya go to the library even during the war?\n(A) They can get free food.\n(B) They find joy and hope in reading.\n(C) They want to learn how to win the war.\n(D) Their school teachers give lessons there.\n\n( )21. Which is true about Darayya’s library?\n(A) It was built during the war.\n(B) It has been bombed many times.\n(C) It was built to remember people who died in the war.\n(D) Most of its books are collected from outside of Darayya.",

Although it’s not an official medical term, this expression is used to explain how TikTok captures our attention and influences behavior, particularly among young people. Research suggests that excessive TikTok use can disrupt your ability to concentrate on tasks requiring extended attention. This is particularly harmful for children and teens, whose brains are still developing the ability to sustain prolonged focus.\nAside from TikTok, platforms like YouTube and Instagram are also adopting the addictive features of short video applications to attract young viewers. To address this issue, some social media companies are initiating measures to help younger users manage their time more effectively. TikTok, for example, sends reminders to users to take a break, stretch or go for a walk. While social media can be entertaining, don’t let it dominate your brain. Stay aware, establish boundaries, and you can strike a balance between digital enjoyment and real‑world responsibilities.\n*scroll (v) *vanish (v) *capture (v) *excessive (a) *disrupt (v) *extended (a) *sustain (v) *prolonged *platform (n) *initiate (v) *preference (n)\n\n44.

Many people may worry that AI will take over their jobs or make them obsolete. However, AI is actually more of a tool that can assist us with lots of things.\nOne of the biggest things of AI is its ability to analyze large amounts of data and make predictions based on that data. This can be useful in fields such as healthcare, finance, and transportation. For example, AI can help doctors make more correct diagnoses by analyzing medical records and symptoms.\nAI can also help us in our day-to-day lives. Virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant use AI to understand and respond to our orders. This makes things such as setting reminders, playing music, and searching for information much easier.\nOf course, there are also concerns about the wrong use of AI. Deepfake videos, for example, use AI to make videos in a way that makes them look real-life, but they can also be used to spread wrong information or create fake news. It is important for us to be careful and this could be dangerous.\nTherefore, AI is not something to be afraid of. It is a powerful tool that can simplify our lives and help us solve difficult problems. However, we must also be responsible users and be aware of the risks. With the right precautions, AI has the potential to make our world a better place.\n\n47. What is the best topic of the article? (A) AI is a tool that can assist us in various tasks. (B) AI can analyze large amounts of data and make predictions. (C) Don’t be afraid of AI. (D) AI can be used to spread misinformation or create fake news.\n48. According to the article, what are some things that can benefit from AI? (A) Agriculture and education. (B) Healthcare, finance, and transportation. (C) Hospitality and entertainment. (D) None of the above.\n49. What does the article say about virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa? (A) They can help doctors make accurate diagnoses. (B) They can assist in detecting all activities. (C) They use AI to understand and respond to our orders. (D) They do nothing.\n50. What is the conclusion the article draws about AI? (A) AI is a powerful tool that can simplify our lives and help us solve complex problems. (B) AI is not a useful tool. (C) AI is something to be afraid of. (D) AI is a potential danger and we shouldn’t use it.",

    "chunk_text": "If you visit Spain, you will hear people speaking Spanish most of the time. But if you go north to the Basque Country, you will also hear a language that is only spoken there: Euskara. Nobody knows when people began to speak Euskara, but one thing is for sure: It was already in Europe before any other language arrived. Having a sense of humor is something most people think of as being uniquely human. It is so important to us that we can already understand it when we’re just babies. Humor makes us laugh, and laughing helps build relationships and brings people together. Although Euskara has been around for thousands of years, it experienced its worst time in the 1990s, when it almost died out. A sense of humor can bring joy, help us be smarter, healthier, and deal with difficult problems. It can also help us think outside the box. It can teach us not to take things so seriously. It can also teach everyone not to laugh at ourselves. People who laugh a lot are not sad or sick very often, neither are those who laugh with them. When the mind is healthy, so is the body. Children who have a sense of humor seem happier. Those who can appreciate and share humor are also more sociable and usually have more friends. But most of all, humor can make life really fun. There’s nothing quite like laughing so hard that your stomach hurts or until tears are running down your face. A sense of humor is not something we’re born with, though. It is something that we learn and grows with us. It also changes when we get older, much like we do. Things that we find funny as kids become too childish to make us laugh when we’re grown up. Babies, for example, don’t really understand humor yet. They just laugh when something we do is funny to them. As children get older, they turn to physical humor and doing funny things either to make themselves or others laugh. From 1939 to 1975, when Spain was in Francisco Franco’s hands, and everyone had to use Spanish only. Under this rule, people who were heard speaking other languages would be stopped by the police. And the police were always around, so the Basque people were afraid to speak Euskara in any public places. They felt that even the walls were listening. Over time, the Basque people spoke Euskara less and less, and some families even stopped teaching their children the language. To save Euskara, some people set up language schools to teach Euskara. Because of their hard work, Euskara was not “killed” but lived on long after Franco died. Although Euskara is heard and seen across the Basque Country today, Spanish is still more commonly used in Spain. However, many people who know Euskara still choose to speak Spanish in public places. For this reason, some people have started to worry about the future of Euskara. How long can it live?\n\n39. ( ) According to the chart, most people agree that it is not a _______.\n(A) in the street.\n(B) at a restaurant.\n(C) in a meeting.\n(D) at the movie theater.\n\n40.

( ) Why did the Basque people feel that even the walls were listening?\n(A) Because the police would stop people when they spoke Spanish.\n(B) Because Euskara could be heard everywhere.\n(C) Because the language schools taught students listening skills.\n(D) Because they were scared of being heard speaking Euskara.\n\n42.

Some of them will not have hope anymore and even kill themselves.\nBullying is when someone makes you feel bad or hurts you again and again.\nMany kids think of bullying as hitting or pushing, but it is more than that. Calling people mean names, laughing at people, speaking something bad about people, taking someone’s things without permission, and not letting someone play in a group are also bullying. Now we even have cyberbullying, and it happens online. Bullying can happen at any age, anywhere, and anytime. It can happen for different reasons. Some students bully others just because they want to get more attention. Some of them feel powerful or popular by bullying others.\nIf someone is mean to you, ignore him or her and show that you don’t care about it at all. When the bullies see that you don’t care about it, they may feel bored and then stop bullying. If you really don’t know how to do it, you can talk to your parents or teachers. They may help you.\nIf you are a teacher or a parent and students come to tell you that someone bullies them, please make them feel safe and listen to them without judgement. Try to help them as much as you can. We all have a job to stop bullying.\nbully  permission  reason ignore\njudgment \n( ) 46.

However, there are some differences between American English and Canadian English in daily usages. Could you share them with me a little bit?\nJoshua: Sure! There are some interesting differences between the two. Let's start with the spelling. People in Canada spell \"colour\" with a \"u\" and \"centre.\" They don’t spell \"color\" and \"center.\" Canadians often follow British English rules when it comes to spelling.\nPatty: Ah, I see. It's not common in Taiwan but it’s interesting. And what about words for everyday things? Do you have any special Canadian terms?\nJoshua: Yes, for example, Canadians say \"washroom\" when Americans say \"restroom\" or \"bathroom,” and they say “biscuits” when we say “cookies.” When we ordered a popular sandwich with fries and gravy, Canadians call it \"poutine.\"\nPatty: Poutine! I know that. Americans just call it \"fries with gravy,\" but \"poutine\" sounds fun.\nJoshua: It's a delicious treat, for sure. Last, Canadians are known for their politeness, so you might hear they say \"sorry\" very often, even when it's not necessary. I once saw a closed store and there was a sign outside by the door. It said, “I’m sorry. We don’t open.”\nPatty: Oh, it’s a lot of fun. I've heard about that Canadian politeness. Americans say \"sorry\" too, but not so often.\nJoshua: Well, Patty, I hope this chat helps you get more ideas about the differences between American and Canadian English.\n however  difference  common  gravy  politeness  necessary \n42.

To save theirs lives, giving CPR is the first thing to do. However, not many people can do CPR. This causes a high death rate from cardiac arrest. In the USA, about 320,000 people die from cardiac arrest out of the hospital each year, and 70% of them happen at home. Cardiac arrest can happen to people around us at any time. When we put all the facts together, it is easy to see one thing : Everyone needs to learn to do CPR, even children.\nWe don’t need to be an expert to give CPR, but we do need some education. It is easy to find CPR classes at schools, in hospitals, or even at fire stations, so signing up for one is not difficult at all. When we see people experiencing cardiac arrest, it’s everyone’s job to help them. Their lives are in our hands.\n\n1. ( ) What is the writer’s main purpose?\n(A) To ask more people to learn CPR.

Then you drop it and it falls, you pray for it to land on the side without butter on. However it lands butter-side down! This is a perfect example of Murphy’s Law.\nDid you notice that it always rains when you least expect it? Or when you stand in line at a checkout, why does the line next to yours always seem to move faster? And why does your teacher call on you when you don’t know the answer to a question? If it is possible for something to wrong, it will go wrong—this is Murphy’s Law.\nThe lesson behind Murphy’s Law is to be prepared for the worst. So, if you aren’t ready for tomorrow’s test, don’t even think about cheating because you will get caught. Study hard.\n\n4. ( ) Which is NOT an example() of Murphy’s Law?\n(A) When you forget your wallet, someone pays for you.\n(B) You just finished washing your car, and it starts to rain.\n(C) The school bus always comes late when you have a test on that day.\n(D) You need to talk to someone right away, but they aren’t answering the phone.\n\n5. ( ) Which of the following is NOT the lesson from Murphy’s Law?\n(A) Always have more than one plan ready.\n(B) Hope for the best, prepare for the worst.\n(C) Everything will go wrong, so we don’t need to try hard.\n(D) Anything can happen, so we always need to be prepared.",

    "chunk_text": "Fake Eyes Protect Cows\nImagine that you are a farmer and keep hundreds of cows. However, large predators like lions come and eat your cows. What will you do to solve this problem? Many people would hunt those lions. This is what farmers in the Okavango Delta in Botswana used to do. They shot the lions with guns, but the problem did not go away. For many years, cows died because of lions, and lions died because of people. The number of lions in Africa has dropped from more than 100,000 in the 1900s to lower than 30,000 in 2020.\n\nLuckily, an Australian biologist named Neil Jordan from the University of New South Wales came up with a smart idea to save both cows and lions. It is to paint eyes on cows butts. In his four-year-study, he followed over 2,000 cows at 14 different farms in the Okavango area. There were 683 with eye-painted butts, but 543 with “X” painted on their butts, and 835 unpainted. The study showed that no cows from the butt-painted group were killed by lions. Jordan was not surprised. He knew before this study that lions usually give up their hunt if they think they’ve been spotted. Now, farmers in Botswana may not need to shoot lions ever again. Sometimes the best way to solve a problem is not to “kill” it but to understand it and “live” with it peacefully.\n\n6. ( ) How many cows with fake eyes painted on their butts were killed() by lions in Jordan’s four-year-study?\n(A) 0. (B) 14. (C) 683. (D) More than 2,000.\n\n7. ( ) What is “the problem” mentioned() in the first paragraph()?\n(A) People keep too many cows. (B) Lions killed the cows.\n(C) People killed lions. (D) The number of lions is dropping.",

Today, a large number of people from all over the world have experienced this activity. Not all the famines are the same in every country. New Zealand, Australia, and South Africa hold a 40-hour famine; Taiwan, the United States and Canada hold a 30-hour famine; the UK and South Korea hold a 24-hour famine; the Philippines holds a 12-hour famine, and Hong Kong holds an 8-hour famine for old people. In 2006, the 17th year of the 30-hour famine in Taiwan, World Vision Taiwan held the DIY Famine. From then on, you can invite a group of more than 10 of your friends, classmates, family members, or co‑workers, pick a time and a place, and start planning your very own DIY famine. If you are not able to join a group, you are also welcome to hold a DIY famine at home. But please note: ◎Anyone younger than 18 must ask their parents first. ◎During the famine, make sure to have enough water or juice. ◎Pregnant women or patients, please do not join the famine. ◎After finishing the famine, start with a light meal. ◎Children under twelve years old are not good for the famine. They can give up on snacks for a day.\n\n1. How long has the 30-hour famine been in Taiwan?\n(A) Since 1971. (B) Since 2006. (C) For seventeen years. (D) For over twenty-five years.\n\n2.

    "chunk_text": "Fake news is something that is not true. It is usually shown as real news on the Internet and used to hurt the reputation of a person or a country. Though fake news has existed for thousands of years, it is still difficult for most modern people to tell whether news is fake or not. For example, when some countries were fighting the pandemic, a lot of fake news said there was not enough rice on the market because farmers in some rice-growing countries could only stay home all day long. Some totalitarian countries sent the fake news with several pictures to worry people who live in free countries and made them not believe in their own countries. Free countries made it clear that it was fake news right away, but it was still not useful because millions of people read it on the Internet. Many countries try to catch those who make fake news, but the best way to fight fake news is to teach people to spot fake news. First, we have to check the writer and the date. Check if the writer is real, and remember old news is not always relevant to what you see now. Second, don’t let your bias make you believe the fake news, which means you need to think twice after reading any stories on the Internet. Third, ask people who have knowledge about what you are not sure of. Taking these actions may not make fake news die, but more people will be able to fight fake news successfully.\n\n41. Which of the following words has the opposite meaning of “totalitarian”?\n(A) Enough. (B) Useful. (C) Successful. (D) Free.\n\n42. From the reading, which of the following is NOT a useful way to fight fake news?\n(A) Telling people not to believe it. (B) Asking people who understand it.\n(C) Checking the date and writer carefully. (D) Thinking twice after listening to the stories.\n\n43. Which of the following is NOT true about fake news?\n(A) It worried a lot of people when we were fighting the pandemic.\n(B) It didn’t appear in history until modern times.\n(C) Catching those who send fake news will not make fake news die.\n(D) Teaching people to spot fake news helps people fight fake news.\n\n44. Who might care if the news is fake or not?\n(A) Henry : The headline on the news is so surprising that I will share it with all my friends. They should know it right now, too.\n(B) Sam : The story on the website is very touching. I have no idea who wrote it, but that’s OK.\n(C) Jason : I am not sure whether the report about new medicine is true. My uncle is a doctor. Maybe I can ask him.\n(D) Peter : The angles of the news are the same as mine. I totally agree with it and I think it is the trusted report.",

It’s a wonderful place with good food and cool people. I ordered their famous steak. It was delicious. However, there was one thing I didn’t like: The waiter wasn’t polite to my kids when they made some noise. I hope he could talk in a nicer way to young kids.\nCustomer 4: The restaurant where we planned to go was full of people, so we left. Then we came into this one and were right away served with some warm bread. We were really surprised by that. All drinks are only $5 each during happy hour. The Pink Lady I drank was great.

Usually, it’s over an hour to make a video. I try to make about five, so it takes most of my day. Then, from Tuesday to Friday, I edit them.”\n\nIt also takes Jessii a few hours a week to write to her fans. Sometimes she meets fans when she goes out. Every time the fans recognize her, they want to take photos with her. However, online life isn’t all good. Jessii feels sad when people say something bad about her. She found a different way to think. “I can’t change myself to make everyone like me. I should believe in myself. Those people make mean comments online just because they don’t feel good about themselves.”\n\nIf you want to be a YouTuber, here are some advice from Jessii. First, safe is very important, so don’t show your face or real name and don’t tell people where you live. Second, be yourself. When you are not being the real you, you may look uneasy in videos, and that cannot catch people’s eye at all. Third, make videos about something you love or care. That way, you can always have fun filming. Last, it’s OK to turn off comments. Mean comments can make you unhappy and even sick. Nothing is more important than your health.\n\n( ) 1.

    "chunk_text": "Do you sometimes feel someone is standing too close to you? Or maybe the person you're talking to keeps backing away, and you try to stay close by stepping closer to him or her? If so, it's probably because of different ideas about the personal space between you and the person you're talking to. According to one study, these ideas may have something to do with where you come from.\nThe study shows that people in different countries have different ideas about personal space. Romanians like to keep the greatest distance between themselves and someone they've just met. They usually keep a distance of 1.3 meters between themselves and others.\nHowever, Argentinians stand the closest to other people, at a distance of only about 76 centimeters.\nAnother interesting thing was also found. People from hot and cold countries show the greatest differences in distance. This makes some people think that people in warmer places are friendlier. Whether that's true or not, one thing is for sure such differences could lead to misunderstanding. So, it's important to keep the right distance, or the person you're talking to might think you're invading his or her personal space. As a result, he or she might not feel comfortable around you.\n\n30. Which of the following is the best title for this news?\n(A) Less Is More\n(B) Save the Best for the Last\n(C) Don't Stand So Close\n(D) You Only Live Once\n\n31. According to the study, which of the following is NOT true?\n(A) Romanians keep the longest distance when they talk with others.\n(B) Argentinians stand the closest to people when they talk with others.\n(C) People from cold countries stand closer to each other than those from warm countries.\n(D) Ideas about personal space may have something to do with where people are from.\n\n32. What does it mean to say that you are \"invading\" someone's personal space?\n(A) It means that you are talking at a distance that makes others comfortable.\n(B) It means that you are talking at a distance greater than 1.3 meters.\n(C) It means that you are talking at a distance less than 76 centimeters.\n(D) It means that you are standing at a distance that doesn't make others feel comfortable.",

Sadly, I even drove to places that were less than five minutes away on foot. I now know that was bad of me. However, all that has changed. On Car Free Day and all the other days of the year, I ride my bike to the places I need to go.\nAt first, it was very difficult for me to get to places that were far away from my house because I was out of shape and got tired really easily. Then, over time, I got stronger and could travel to spots that were miles away.\nNow, there isn’t a day that I don’t take my bike out somewhere nice in nature.\nBiking has truly helped me see the world in a whole new way. What’s more, I can’t imagine going back to the life that wasn’t good for me or the environment.\nAll the best,\nDerek\n\n33. What is the purpose of this letter?\n(A) To tell a bike company their products were made poorly.\n(B) To tell people about a way of travel that doesn’t need gas.\n(C) To explain a new way of travel that takes people out in nature quickly.\n(D) To share a story that is all about cars with a group of readers.",

Check the following list of habits to see if they are the reasons for the problem and if you have any of them.\n1. Everything has to be perfect, and you feel unhappy when it is not. You work really hard to reach this goal, but sometimes it is not what you are able to do. In the end, the only thing you get is wasted time.\n2. Fast food is a big part of your everyday life. It is convenient to have fast food, but it is not healthy, and it makes your blood sugar higher. To bring that back down to a safe level, you need to change your eating habits, for example, get more fresh fruit and vegetables.\n3. Your desk is always in a mess. Get things in order by cleaning up your desk, making it neat, and putting things that you don’t need in the drawers. Before leaving the office, get everything ready for the next morning.\n4. You always go to bed late on weekends. If you stay up late on Saturday night and sleep late on Sunday morning, you will have problems getting to sleep on Sunday night. What you need to do is to get up at the same hour and take a short break in the afternoon.\n5. You don’t exercise when you have free time. You need to get 30 minutes of exercise a day, five days a week. That will help you grow stronger.\n\n36. What does “it” refer to?\n(A) Making profits.\n(B) Working hard.\n(C) Being perfect.\n(D) Feeling unhappy.\n\n37. Allen works eight hours a day and is always late for work on Mondays because he stays up the night before. Also, he is tired of exercising because he gets too tired on workdays. When he is at his desk, he has no idea where to start because there are things everywhere. At noon, he usually has an apple and a salad with some chicken. How many items on the list does Allen most likely to make a check?\n(A) 1.\n(B) 2.\n(C) 3.\n(D) 4.\n\n38. What is the main idea of the reading?\n(A) Being too tired is good for your life.\n(B) Actions speak louder than words.\n(C) Work is more important than one’s health.\n(D) Bad living habits make your health worse.",

So, why do food and drinks on airplanes taste different?\nIn fact, we tell flavors through our senses of smell and taste. Sadly, those two senses become less strong when we fly 30,000 feet above the Earth. The humidity level in the air is only 12%, and the air pressure is really low. As a result, our noses don’t work so well. When our noses don’t work well, our sense of taste doesn’t, either. That is because 80% of our sense of taste comes from our sense of smell. Therefore, salty and sweet flavors go down by about 30%. Besides, the loud noise from the plane makes the problem even worse. Luckily, we can still taste bitter, sour, and spicy flavors.\nNow, you know what changes the taste of food and drinks on airplanes. So, next time you are on a plane and taste something bad, the problem may not be with the cooks.\n\n22. What are the airlines most likely doing to make their food taste better?\n(A) Using sugar as little as possible.\n(B) Adding more salt to their dishes.\n(C) Cooking with a lot of chili pepper.\n(D) Putting twice vinegar in the food.\n\n23. According to the reading, which does NOT make airplane food taste bad?\n(A) The dry air.\n(B) The low air pressure.\n(C) The loud noise from the plane.\n(D) The cooks on the plane.\n\n24. Which chart shows the changes when we fly?\n(A) (B)\n(C) (D)",
