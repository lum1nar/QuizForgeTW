Although that is enough to keep most people away from those animals, one part of them that has been received with open arms is their fins. The Chinese eat it in the way of a soup, which they say has many things that are good for people’s health. The dish has even grown to become a sign of wealth and class for them.\nFor many others, shark fin soup is mean and not needed. The reason for that is how the shark fin is taken. It is called shark-finning, and it cuts the fins off living sharks before throwing them back into the ocean. There, they not only lose blood and die, but they also become food for other sea animals. Shark-finning is threatening the sharks and the oceans because the animals grow slowly and some types are already dying off. Millions of these sea animals die every year, which throws everything off balance.\nLucky for us, governments across the planet have taken action to try to fix this problem. In 2000, the USA made shark-finning illegal. Also, Palau, the Maldives, and the Bahamas have set up natural places that are safe for sharks. Thanks to those actions and others, people have become more aware. More people who are getting married don’t have shark fin soup at their weddings. Also, some restaurants have taken the dish off their menus.\n\n29. How do people feel about shark fin soup?\n(A) The Chinese think it’s a sign of being rich.\n(B) Americans love how the fins are taken.\n(C) Everybody knows it’s good for your health.\n(D) Nobody wants it to be taken off the menu.\n30.

The reason for that is I’ve been busy seeing the sights and having the time of my life. This is the first chance I’ve gotten to sit down and check my e-mails.\nAnyway, it’s time that you catch up on what I’ve been up to since I checked in at my hotel on Monday. Yesterday, I got up early because I planned to walk across the Brooklyn Bridge, check out Wall Street, and then visit the 911 Memorial. When I got to the bridge, it was blocked off because a group of people were filming a movie. I moved closer to see if I knew anybody. You’re not going to believe this, but I saw my favorite actor, Tom Hanks, acting there. I tried to take a picture of him, but a guard stopped me before I could. He told me I could stay around and watch as long as I kept quiet and didn’t try that again. Though it was interesting, I decided to leave and finish what I set out to do. The day before that, I spent most of my time exploring Central Park and some of the museums around there. Also, on the first morning, I headed straight for the Empire State Building and then Times Square because I was dying to see them.\nThere’s too much to share in one e-mail, so I’ll tell you more next time.

I had no idea about it until I left the office. I saw that many of the traffic lights were out when I was riding my scooter home.\nKen: You were one of the lucky ones because where I was had no power when it first went out. It lasted for about three hours.\nCindy: That must have been terrible! I read in the paper today that close to seven million people were affected.\nKen: I learned from the news this morning that this was all because someone at the power company made the mistake of turning something important off for a few minutes. By the time they noticed it, six of the machines that make the power already stopped working.\nCindy: Yeah, and I heard that the fire department got over one hundred calls about people who couldn’t get out of elevators. It sounds scary! I had that kind of experience before. I was stuck in the elevator for about one and a half hours, and it was the worst experience I’ve ever had.\nKen: If you think that’s bad, how about the people down in the metro or high up in the air in the cable cars? That would be ten times worse!\nCindy: Well, I’m just glad that all that is over now and that nobody got hurt because of the power cut.\n\n affect  blackout  traffic light  fire department  elevator \n34.

The company’s website became one of the 50 most‑visited in the world this year.\nPeople can ask the chatbot a question, and it will reply with an answer in essay form. Students and teachers are considering the effects of this on schools.\nSome school districts have banned ChatGPT. Some teachers see it as a tool that can be used to cheat. However, many educators say it’s too late to keep AI out of their classrooms. Some think ChatGPT is to English and writing what the calculator is to math. Some teachers said ChatGPT helped them come up with creative ideas for classes and to simplify texts for students not fluent in English.\nChatGPT’s answers are not always right. Text generated by ChatGPT often contains factual errors, can be in the wrong format, or the tone can be off. What’s more, it may contain biases from the data it uses. For example, the views, knowledge, and experiences of smaller communities are less represented.\nSome say those with access to a high‑speed Internet connection will be able to use AI consistently, but many students do not have that access. So allowing the use of AI for schoolwork could also lead to an unfair situation that will benefit some students over others.\n\n49. What is ChatGPT?\n(A) A chatbot.\n(B) A smartphone.\n(C) A teacher.\n(D) A student.\n\n50.

However, it is different from any libraries you know. It is a secret underground library, and only people in Darayya know where it is.\nOver the years, war has shaken Darayya badly. Every day, houses are bombed and people are killed.\nStores are closed one after another, and schools are, too. To help the kids in Darayya with their learning, Anas Ahmad, a 19-year‑year-old student, and his friends decided to build a library. They built the library under the ground to keep it safe from bombing. But it is dangerous to collect books for the library. Often, Ahmad and his friends look for books in houses that were bombed. They need to be careful because they may be killed in another bombing.\nYou may ask, “In a place like Darayya, would people be interested in books?” “Just like the body needs food, the mind needs books,” says one library user. In the library, people enjoy their time of reading and forget about the terrible world above. Through reading, they are able to dream of a better life after war.\n\n( )19. Below are the ideas that are talked about in the reading.\na. The problems Darayya has.\nb. How Darayya’s library was started.\nc. What makes Darayya’s library special.\nd.

Leopards are the smallest of the big cats. They are good at climbing. The leopard may look small, but it has lots of power. Jaguars come from America. They have cool spots and have the strongest bite of all the big cats. They are known to eat more than 85 species of prey, including deer, squirrels, birds, and even snails. A lion lives with its family and has no fear of other animals. Female lions give birth to baby lions. What’s more, mother lions do most of the hunting.

This is particularly harmful for children and teens, whose brains are still developing the ability to sustain prolonged focus.\nAside from TikTok, platforms like YouTube and Instagram are also adopting the addictive features of short video applications to attract young viewers. To address this issue, some social media companies are initiating measures to help younger users manage their time more effectively. TikTok, for example, sends reminders to users to take a break, stretch or go for a walk. While social media can be entertaining, don’t let it dominate your brain. Stay aware, establish boundaries, and you can strike a balance between digital enjoyment and real‑world responsibilities.\n*scroll (v) *vanish (v) *capture (v) *excessive (a) *disrupt (v) *extended (a) *sustain (v) *prolonged *platform (n) *initiate (v) *preference (n)\n\n44.

    "chunk_text": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) can sometimes seem overpower, but there's no need to be afraid of it. In fact, AI can improve our lives in many ways. Many people may worry that AI will take over their jobs or make them obsolete. However, AI is actually more of a tool that can assist us with lots of things.\nOne of the biggest things of AI is its ability to analyze large amounts of data and make predictions based on that data. This can be useful in fields such as healthcare, finance, and transportation. For example, AI can help doctors make more correct diagnoses by analyzing medical records and symptoms.\nAI can also help us in our day-to-day lives. Virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant use AI to understand and respond to our orders. This makes things such as setting reminders, playing music, and searching for information much easier.\nOf course, there are also concerns about the wrong use of AI. Deepfake videos, for example, use AI to make videos in a way that makes them look real-life, but they can also be used to spread wrong information or create fake news. It is important for us to be careful and this could be dangerous.\nTherefore, AI is not something to be afraid of. It is a powerful tool that can simplify our lives and help us solve difficult problems. However, we must also be responsible users and be aware of the risks. With the right precautions, AI has the potential to make our world a better place.\n\n47. What is the best topic of the article? (A) AI is a tool that can assist us in various tasks.

According to the article, what are some things that can benefit from AI? (A) Agriculture and education. (B) Healthcare, finance, and transportation. (C) Hospitality and entertainment. (D) None of the above.\n49. What does the article say about virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa? (A) They can help doctors make accurate diagnoses. (B) They can assist in detecting all activities. (C) They use AI to understand and respond to our orders. (D) They do nothing.\n50. What is the conclusion the article draws about AI? (A) AI is a powerful tool that can simplify our lives and help us solve complex problems. (B) AI is not a useful tool. (C) AI is something to be afraid of. (D) AI is a potential danger and we shouldn’t use it.",

    "chunk_text": "If you visit Spain, you will hear people speaking Spanish most of the time. But if you go north to the Basque Country, you will also hear a language that is only spoken there: Euskara. Nobody knows when people began to speak Euskara, but one thing is for sure: It was already in Europe before any other language arrived. Having a sense of humor is something most people think of as being uniquely human. It is so important to us that we can already understand it when we’re just babies. Humor makes us laugh, and laughing helps build relationships and brings people together. Although Euskara has been around for thousands of years, it experienced its worst time in the 1990s, when it almost died out. A sense of humor can bring joy, help us be smarter, healthier, and deal with difficult problems. It can also help us think outside the box. It can teach us not to take things so seriously. It can also teach everyone not to laugh at ourselves. People who laugh a lot are not sad or sick very often, neither are those who laugh with them. When the mind is healthy, so is the body. Children who have a sense of humor seem happier. Those who can appreciate and share humor are also more sociable and usually have more friends. But most of all, humor can make life really fun. There’s nothing quite like laughing so hard that your stomach hurts or until tears are running down your face. A sense of humor is not something we’re born with, though. It is something that we learn and grows with us. It also changes when we get older, much like we do. Things that we find funny as kids become too childish to make us laugh when we’re grown up. Babies, for example, don’t really understand humor yet. They just laugh when something we do is funny to them. As children get older, they turn to physical humor and doing funny things either to make themselves or others laugh. From 1939 to 1975, when Spain was in Francisco Franco’s hands, and everyone had to use Spanish only. Under this rule, people who were heard speaking other languages would be stopped by the police. And the police were always around, so the Basque people were afraid to speak Euskara in any public places. They felt that even the walls were listening. Over time, the Basque people spoke Euskara less and less, and some families even stopped teaching their children the language. To save Euskara, some people set up language schools to teach Euskara. Because of their hard work, Euskara was not “killed” but lived on long after Franco died. Although Euskara is heard and seen across the Basque Country today, Spanish is still more commonly used in Spain. However, many people who know Euskara still choose to speak Spanish in public places. For this reason, some people have started to worry about the future of Euskara. How long can it live?\n\n39. ( ) According to the chart, most people agree that it is not a _______.\n(A) in the street.\n(B) at a restaurant.\n(C) in a meeting.\n(D) at the movie theater.\n\n40.

Some of them will not have hope anymore and even kill themselves.\nBullying is when someone makes you feel bad or hurts you again and again.\nMany kids think of bullying as hitting or pushing, but it is more than that. Calling people mean names, laughing at people, speaking something bad about people, taking someone’s things without permission, and not letting someone play in a group are also bullying. Now we even have cyberbullying, and it happens online. Bullying can happen at any age, anywhere, and anytime. It can happen for different reasons. Some students bully others just because they want to get more attention. Some of them feel powerful or popular by bullying others.\nIf someone is mean to you, ignore him or her and show that you don’t care about it at all. When the bullies see that you don’t care about it, they may feel bored and then stop bullying. If you really don’t know how to do it, you can talk to your parents or teachers. They may help you.\nIf you are a teacher or a parent and students come to tell you that someone bullies them, please make them feel safe and listen to them without judgement.

However, there are some differences between American English and Canadian English in daily usages. Could you share them with me a little bit?\nJoshua: Sure! There are some interesting differences between the two. Let's start with the spelling. People in Canada spell \"colour\" with a \"u\" and \"centre.\" They don’t spell \"color\" and \"center.\" Canadians often follow British English rules when it comes to spelling.\nPatty: Ah, I see. It's not common in Taiwan but it’s interesting. And what about words for everyday things? Do you have any special Canadian terms?\nJoshua: Yes, for example, Canadians say \"washroom\" when Americans say \"restroom\" or \"bathroom,” and they say “biscuits” when we say “cookies.” When we ordered a popular sandwich with fries and gravy, Canadians call it \"poutine.\"\nPatty: Poutine! I know that. Americans just call it \"fries with gravy,\" but \"poutine\" sounds fun.\nJoshua: It's a delicious treat, for sure. Last, Canadians are known for their politeness, so you might hear they say \"sorry\" very often, even when it's not necessary. I once saw a closed store and there was a sign outside by the door. It said, “I’m sorry. We don’t open.”\nPatty: Oh, it’s a lot of fun. I've heard about that Canadian politeness. Americans say \"sorry\" too, but not so often.\nJoshua: Well, Patty, I hope this chat helps you get more ideas about the differences between American and Canadian English.\n however  difference  common  gravy  politeness  necessary \n42.

To save theirs lives, giving CPR is the first thing to do. However, not many people can do CPR. This causes a high death rate from cardiac arrest. In the USA, about 320,000 people die from cardiac arrest out of the hospital each year, and 70% of them happen at home. Cardiac arrest can happen to people around us at any time. When we put all the facts together, it is easy to see one thing : Everyone needs to learn to do CPR, even children.\nWe don’t need to be an expert to give CPR, but we do need some education. It is easy to find CPR classes at schools, in hospitals, or even at fire stations, so signing up for one is not difficult at all. When we see people experiencing cardiac arrest, it’s everyone’s job to help them. Their lives are in our hands.\n\n1. ( ) What is the writer’s main purpose?\n(A) To ask more people to learn CPR.

    "chunk_text": "Fake Eyes Protect Cows\nImagine that you are a farmer and keep hundreds of cows. However, large predators like lions come and eat your cows. What will you do to solve this problem? Many people would hunt those lions. This is what farmers in the Okavango Delta in Botswana used to do. They shot the lions with guns, but the problem did not go away. For many years, cows died because of lions, and lions died because of people. The number of lions in Africa has dropped from more than 100,000 in the 1900s to lower than 30,000 in 2020.\n\nLuckily, an Australian biologist named Neil Jordan from the University of New South Wales came up with a smart idea to save both cows and lions. It is to paint eyes on cows butts. In his four-year-study, he followed over 2,000 cows at 14 different farms in the Okavango area. There were 683 with eye-painted butts, but 543 with “X” painted on their butts, and 835 unpainted. The study showed that no cows from the butt-painted group were killed by lions. Jordan was not surprised. He knew before this study that lions usually give up their hunt if they think they’ve been spotted. Now, farmers in Botswana may not need to shoot lions ever again. Sometimes the best way to solve a problem is not to “kill” it but to understand it and “live” with it peacefully.\n\n6. ( ) How many cows with fake eyes painted on their butts were killed() by lions in Jordan’s four-year-study?\n(A) 0. (B) 14. (C) 683. (D) More than 2,000.\n\n7. ( ) What is “the problem” mentioned() in the first paragraph()?\n(A) People keep too many cows. (B) Lions killed the cows.\n(C) People killed lions. (D) The number of lions is dropping.",

From then on, you can invite a group of more than 10 of your friends, classmates, family members, or co‑workers, pick a time and a place, and start planning your very own DIY famine.

    "chunk_text": "Fake news is something that is not true. It is usually shown as real news on the Internet and used to hurt the reputation of a person or a country. Though fake news has existed for thousands of years, it is still difficult for most modern people to tell whether news is fake or not. For example, when some countries were fighting the pandemic, a lot of fake news said there was not enough rice on the market because farmers in some rice-growing countries could only stay home all day long. Some totalitarian countries sent the fake news with several pictures to worry people who live in free countries and made them not believe in their own countries. Free countries made it clear that it was fake news right away, but it was still not useful because millions of people read it on the Internet. Many countries try to catch those who make fake news, but the best way to fight fake news is to teach people to spot fake news. First, we have to check the writer and the date. Check if the writer is real, and remember old news is not always relevant to what you see now. Second, don’t let your bias make you believe the fake news, which means you need to think twice after reading any stories on the Internet. Third, ask people who have knowledge about what you are not sure of. Taking these actions may not make fake news die, but more people will be able to fight fake news successfully.\n\n41. Which of the following words has the opposite meaning of “totalitarian”?\n(A) Enough. (B) Useful. (C) Successful. (D) Free.\n\n42. From the reading, which of the following is NOT a useful way to fight fake news?\n(A) Telling people not to believe it. (B) Asking people who understand it.\n(C) Checking the date and writer carefully. (D) Thinking twice after listening to the stories.\n\n43. Which of the following is NOT true about fake news?\n(A) It worried a lot of people when we were fighting the pandemic.\n(B) It didn’t appear in history until modern times.\n(C) Catching those who send fake news will not make fake news die.\n(D) Teaching people to spot fake news helps people fight fake news.\n\n44. Who might care if the news is fake or not?\n(A) Henry : The headline on the news is so surprising that I will share it with all my friends. They should know it right now, too.\n(B) Sam : The story on the website is very touching. I have no idea who wrote it, but that’s OK.\n(C) Jason : I am not sure whether the report about new medicine is true. My uncle is a doctor. Maybe I can ask him.\n(D) Peter : The angles of the news are the same as mine. I totally agree with it and I think it is the trusted report.",

Their sauce is my favorite.\nCustomer 2: This place is pretty good for lunch with friends and family. I like their chicken pie with green beans.

It’s a wonderful place with good food and cool people. I ordered their famous steak. It was delicious. However, there was one thing I didn’t like: The waiter wasn’t polite to my kids when they made some noise. I hope he could talk in a nicer way to young kids.\nCustomer 4: The restaurant where we planned to go was full of people, so we left. Then we came into this one and were right away served with some warm bread. We were really surprised by that. All drinks are only $5 each during happy hour. The Pink Lady I drank was great.

Usually, it’s over an hour to make a video. I try to make about five, so it takes most of my day. Then, from Tuesday to Friday, I edit them.”\n\nIt also takes Jessii a few hours a week to write to her fans. Sometimes she meets fans when she goes out. Every time the fans recognize her, they want to take photos with her. However, online life isn’t all good. Jessii feels sad when people say something bad about her. She found a different way to think. “I can’t change myself to make everyone like me. I should believe in myself. Those people make mean comments online just because they don’t feel good about themselves.”\n\nIf you want to be a YouTuber, here are some advice from Jessii. First, safe is very important, so don’t show your face or real name and don’t tell people where you live. Second, be yourself. When you are not being the real you, you may look uneasy in videos, and that cannot catch people’s eye at all. Third, make videos about something you love or care. That way, you can always have fun filming. Last, it’s OK to turn off comments. Mean comments can make you unhappy and even sick. Nothing is more important than your health.\n\n( ) 1.

Usually, it’s over an hour to make a video. I try to make about five, so it takes most of my day. Then, from Tuesday to Friday, I edit them.”\n\nIt also takes Jessii a few hours a week to write to her fans. Sometimes she meets fans when she goes out. Every time the fans recognize her, they want to take photos with her. However, online life isn’t all good. Jessii feels sad when people say something bad about her. She found a different way to think. “I can’t change myself to make everyone like me. I should believe in myself. Those people make mean comments online just because they don’t feel good about themselves.”\n\nIf you want to be a YouTuber, here are some advice from Jessii. First, 5 safe is very important, so don’t show your face or real name and don’t tell people where you live. Second, 6 yourself. When you are not being the real you, you may look uneasy in videos, and that cannot catch people’s eye at all. Third, make videos about something you love or care. That way, you can always have fun filming. Last, it’s OK 7 comments. Mean comments can make you unhappy and even sick. Nothing is more important than your health.\n\n( ) 4.

Why aren’t prices just even numbers?\nMany stores like to mark their prices to end in .99 for discounts, and customers almost never notice that ____ . Though no one really knows who or how the trick started, it has been around for at least a century. Ending a price in .99 is based on the theory that because we read from left to right, we usually only see the first number of the price. The price ____ starts with a 4 appears to be a better deal than the one that starts with 5. That’s why even though a product for $4.99 may be just one cent cheaper, the trick always helps sell more. ____ , the .99 alone allows people to believe that the item is on sale. Customers have become so used to it and think they are getting a good deal when they buy something with a price ending in .99.\nThe trick doesn’t only work for cents. In other studies about women’s clothes, a dress ____ price is changed from $34 to $39 is sold more by a third while changing it from $34 to $44 doesn’t have many different results.

If so, it's probably because of different ideas about the personal space between you and the person you're talking to. According to one study, these ideas may have something to do with where you come from.\nThe study shows that people in different countries have different ideas about personal space. Romanians like to keep the greatest distance between themselves and someone they've just met. They usually keep a distance of 1.3 meters between themselves and others.\nHowever, Argentinians stand the closest to other people, at a distance of only about 76 centimeters.\nAnother interesting thing was also found. People from hot and cold countries show the greatest differences in distance. This makes some people think that people in warmer places are friendlier. Whether that's true or not, one thing is for sure such differences could lead to misunderstanding. So, it's important to keep the right distance, or the person you're talking to might think you're invading his or her personal space. As a result, he or she might not feel comfortable around you.\n\n30. Which of the following is the best title for this news?\n(A) Less Is More\n(B) Save the Best for the Last\n(C) Don't Stand So Close\n(D) You Only Live Once\n\n31.

What does it mean to say that you are \"invading\" someone's personal space?\n(A) It means that you are talking at a distance that makes others comfortable.\n(B) It means that you are talking at a distance greater than 1.3 meters.\n(C) It means that you are talking at a distance less than 76 centimeters.\n(D) It means that you are standing at a distance that doesn't make others feel comfortable.",

Sadly, I even drove to places that were less than five minutes away on foot. I now know that was bad of me. However, all that has changed. On Car Free Day and all the other days of the year, I ride my bike to the places I need to go.\nAt first, it was very difficult for me to get to places that were far away from my house because I was out of shape and got tired really easily. Then, over time, I got stronger and could travel to spots that were miles away.\nNow, there isn’t a day that I don’t take my bike out somewhere nice in nature.\nBiking has truly helped me see the world in a whole new way. What’s more, I can’t imagine going back to the life that wasn’t good for me or the environment.\nAll the best,\nDerek\n\n33. What is the purpose of this letter?\n(A) To tell a bike company their products were made poorly.\n(B) To tell people about a way of travel that doesn’t need gas.\n(C) To explain a new way of travel that takes people out in nature quickly.\n(D) To share a story that is all about cars with a group of readers.",

Check the following list of habits to see if they are the reasons for the problem and if you have any of them.\n1. Everything has to be perfect, and you feel unhappy when it is not. You work really hard to reach this goal, but sometimes it is not what you are able to do. In the end, the only thing you get is wasted time.\n2. Fast food is a big part of your everyday life. It is convenient to have fast food, but it is not healthy, and it makes your blood sugar higher. To bring that back down to a safe level, you need to change your eating habits, for example, get more fresh fruit and vegetables.\n3. Your desk is always in a mess. Get things in order by cleaning up your desk, making it neat, and putting things that you don’t need in the drawers. Before leaving the office, get everything ready for the next morning.\n4. You always go to bed late on weekends. If you stay up late on Saturday night and sleep late on Sunday morning, you will have problems getting to sleep on Sunday night. What you need to do is to get up at the same hour and take a short break in the afternoon.\n5. You don’t exercise when you have free time. You need to get 30 minutes of exercise a day, five days a week. That will help you grow stronger.\n\n36. What does “it” refer to?\n(A) Making profits.\n(B) Working hard.\n(C) Being perfect.\n(D) Feeling unhappy.\n\n37. Allen works eight hours a day and is always late for work on Mondays because he stays up the night before. Also, he is tired of exercising because he gets too tired on workdays. When he is at his desk, he has no idea where to start because there are things everywhere. At noon, he usually has an apple and a salad with some chicken. How many items on the list does Allen most likely to make a check?\n(A) 1.\n(B) 2.\n(C) 3.\n(D) 4.\n\n38. What is the main idea of the reading?\n(A) Being too tired is good for your life.\n(B) Actions speak louder than words.\n(C) Work is more important than one’s health.\n(D) Bad living habits make your health worse.",

    "chunk_text": "You are on a plane and ready to take your first bite of airplane food, but it doesn’t taste as good as it does on land. So, why do food and drinks on airplanes taste different?\nIn fact, we tell flavors through our senses of smell and taste. Sadly, those two senses become less strong when we fly 30,000 feet above the Earth. The humidity level in the air is only 12%, and the air pressure is really low. As a result, our noses don’t work so well. When our noses don’t work well, our sense of taste doesn’t, either. That is because 80% of our sense of taste comes from our sense of smell. Therefore, salty and sweet flavors go down by about 30%. Besides, the loud noise from the plane makes the problem even worse. Luckily, we can still taste bitter, sour, and spicy flavors.\nNow, you know what changes the taste of food and drinks on airplanes. So, next time you are on a plane and taste something bad, the problem may not be with the cooks.\n\n22. What are the airlines most likely doing to make their food taste better?\n(A) Using sugar as little as possible.\n(B) Adding more salt to their dishes.\n(C) Cooking with a lot of chili pepper.\n(D) Putting twice vinegar in the food.\n\n23. According to the reading, which does NOT make airplane food taste bad?\n(A) The dry air.\n(B) The low air pressure.\n(C) The loud noise from the plane.\n(D) The cooks on the plane.\n\n24. Which chart shows the changes when we fly?\n(A) (B)\n(C) (D)",

I saw my father put a letter in the coffin. I asked him about the letter. He told me it was a letter to his brother. My father said that sometimes he wrote letters to his brother when he missed him. \"But how can you write a letter to someone who is dead?\" I asked. \"You can,\" he said. \"It makes me feel good.\" A few days later, my father gave me a notebook. \"When you miss me, write me a letter,\" he said. \"Even if I'm sitting right next to you, you can still write me a letter.\" I started writing letters to my father every day. Sometimes I wrote about what happened at school. Other times I wrote about my dreams for the future. Whenever I had a problem, I wrote about it in my letter.

However, the well was too deep for the horse to get out of. The farmer felt bad for the horse, but he didn't know how to save it. He then decided to bury it in the well because neither the old horse nor the dry well was useful to him anymore.\nThe farmer had his friends come to help him throw dirt into the well. The horse started to cry when it saw what was happening. But suddenly, an idea came to its mind. Every time the dirt hit its back, the horse would shake it off and walk on it. Finally, enough dirt was thrown into the well, and the horse was able to jump out. The horse didn't give up when it was being buried. Instead, the horse found a way to save itself. The lesson of the story is simple: when life gives you lemons, make lemonade.\n\n45. What would a well look like?\n(A) (B) (C) (D)\n46.

    "chunk_text": "Thor Pedersen is a Danish traveler. He recently finished a trip around the world. However, this wasn’t just any trip. He spent nearly ten years visiting every country in the world - and he did it all without flying.\nAs Thor began to plan his trip, he made a few rules; no flying, no visiting home, and spend at least 24 hours in every country. He hoped that he could live on about $20 a day, and finish his trip in about 4 years. Actually, it took him far longer.\nThe first part of his trip was pretty easy. He traveled across Europe and North America. But as he moved on to other parts of the world, things began to get much harder. To cross large bodies of water, Mr. Pedersen took boats. Besides, he traveled by taxi, bus, train, and even walking. Sometimes he paid for a place to stay; sometimes people invited him into their homes. At other times, he had to sleep outside. Mr. Pedersen says he had many difficult experiences. He was once held at gunpoint and thought he might be killed. On the other hand, he also had many good experiences. Thor says why he didn’t give up was the help from people all over the world.\nMr. Pedersen’s girlfriend visited him several times as he traveled. When she visited him in Kenya, he asked her to marry him. But before they could get married, the coronavirus pandemic began. Therefore, Mr. Pedersen got stuck in Hong Kong for two years. Luckily, after getting married online, his wife was able to join him for part of that time. Finally, Mr. Pedersen arrived back in Denmark after a 33-day boat ride. He was met by about 150 people, including friends and family members.\nMr. Pedersen has covered around 260,000 miles – about 10 times the distance around the Earth. Later, he plans to write a book and share what he learned in his travels around the world.\n\n27. According to the reading, Mr. Pedersen planned and took the trip with many ways. Which DIDN’T he expect to use?\n(A) (B) (C) (D)\n28. Based on the reading, which is true?\n(A) Thor traveled around the world without anyone getting along.\n(B) It took Thor four years to take the trip all over the world.\n(C) Mr. Pedersen got married with his girlfriend when they were in Kenya.\n(D) Thor Pedersen stayed in Hong Kong for two years because of coronavirus pandemic.",

    "chunk_text": "Brights Zoo in Limestone, Tennessee is celebrating the birth of a very unusual baby giraffe. What makes this giraffe special is that it doesn’t have any spots. The zoo is asking for help from the public to name the animal.\nTall, long-necked giraffes are famous for their spots. A giraffe’s spots are created when the animal is still growing inside its mother. The spots are believed to help the animals hide from their enemies. The skin below the spots may also help giraffes stay at the right temperature. Just like no two persons have the same fingerprints, each giraffe has its own special spots.\nOn July 31, 2023, a baby giraffe was born at Brights Zoo with no spots at all. Instead, its hair is a light brown. It was born perfectly healthy. It just doesn’t have any spots. The young giraffe is believed to be the only spotless giraffe in the world. Mr. Bright, the zoo keeper, says that the new giraffe might not have been alive if it had been born in the wild. Brights Zoo is hoping to use the young spotless giraffe to bring attention to protect giraffes. Mr. Bright says the zoo hopes to raise money for groups like Save Giraffes Now and the Giraffe Conservation Foundation.\nSo far, the young giraffe has not been given a name. Mr. Bright says that his family has thought up thousands of names, and has come up with four possible choices. All of the names are in Swahili, a language spoken in parts of Africa. The zoo will present the winning name later.\n\n29. The zoo is providing some choices for the public to name the new-born giraffe. Which might NOT be on the list?\n(A) Kipekee - Special\n(B) Shakiri – She is the most beautiful\n(C) Kawaida - Common\n(D) Jamella – One of great beauty\n30. After reading it, which one is true?\n(A) The zoo expects to use the spotless giraffe to raise money for some groups.\n(B) A giraffe’s spot is grown after it is born.\n(C) The giraffe might be in danger when it is raised in the zoo.\n(D) One giraffe may look the same as its brother.",

    "chunk_text": "A book company in the United Kingdom (UK) has been criticized for changing the words in some of Roald Dahl’s famous children’s books. The publisher said it wanted to make sure the books could “be enjoyed by all.” But many people were mad by these changes.\nRoald Dahl was a popular British writer. He wrote many books for children. Several of his books have been made into movies. Mr. Dahl’s stories are often meant to be funny. The books have unusual characters, and subjects are common. Many of Mr. Dahl’s stories are about children, and the children are smarter than grownups. Some grownups in his books are hateful, and they treat children badly. His stories have been enjoyed by millions of young readers. But some people believe that some of Mr. Dahl’s books could also be insulting – especially how he shows some characters.\nThe book company, Puffin, changed Mr. Dahl’s books, so these books wouldn’t cover anything insulting. The English newspaper, the Daily Telegraph, reported that Puffin had created new of many of Mr. Dahl’s books with “hundreds of changes.”\nFor example, the word “fat” was taken out of the books. So were the words “ugly” and “crazy.” Instead of “boys and girls,” the new books use the word “children.” Instead of “mothers” or “fathers,” the new books talk about “parents” or “family.” Though Puffin made the changes to avoid insults, the changes in the new books have made many people angry. They say the changes limit the freedom of writers to tell stories in their own ways.\nIn response, Puffin has said that it will now also publish the old books as “The Roald Dahl Classic Collection.” The readers will be able to choose which version of the stories they want to buy.\n\n31. Which was NOT the reason the publisher changed some words of Roald Dahl’s book?\n(A) To limit Roald Dahl’s way to write stories.\n(B) To let these books be enjoyed by all people.\n(C) To make words more hurtless to people.\n(D) To have these stories avoid covering something insulting.\n\n32. Which might be the new version of Roald Dahl’s books?\n(A) This is Mr. Bucket. This is Mrs. Bucket. Mr. and Mrs. Bucket have a small boy whose name is Charlie. The whole of this family live together in a small wooden house on the edge of a great town. (Charlie And The Chocolate Factory)\n(B) It’s a funny thing about mothers and fathers. Even when their own child is the most disgusting little blister you could ever imagine, they still think that he or she is wonderful. (Matilda)\n(C) The Centipede sings: “Aunt Sponge was terrifically fat / And tremendously flabby at that,” and, “Aunt Spiker was thin as a wire / And dry as a bone, only drier.” (James and the Giant Peach)\n(D) Besides, there are plenty of other reasons why women might wear wigs and there is certainly nothing wrong with that. (The Witches)",

And this is why he has loved and been good at history since he was in elementary school.\nSome of Dad’s collections are from Grandfather. They are ancient and special, bigger and with square holes in them. Some of his collections come from the countries he has been to, and some are from his friends.\nMy mother collects stamps. In her eyes, each stamp is like a piece of artwork. She always wears gloves when touching them. Like Dad, she has got her stamps from her trips abroad or her friends.\nAs for me, I collect toy cars. I have been crazy about cars since I was three. To satisfy my great interest in cars, Dad and Mom keep buying me toy cars. All my relatives that know about my interest never fail to give me toy cars as birthday presents. So far, I have collected more than 300 toy cars, all of which are kept in the cupboard in my room.\n\n( )31.

The problem is that the microplastic is too small to see(～～). Most people don’t give enough care. Besides, the new study shows that each one of us eats almost “a credit card” every day. We might eat them while having seafood, breathing() them in through the air, or eating food with plastic packaging. For example, when we drink bottled water, we also drink a lot of microplastics at the same time. Microplastics become a terrible killer in our lives. Scientists care about this problem. They try hard to find out the truth about microplastics. They set a special machine outside to see what happens. They said, “You will see all kinds of shining plastic pieces in the air. The view is terrible. We are sure that you can also see lots of microplastics in the buildings.” When people breathe in microplastics, they might have health problem. What’s more, scientists point out another problem. If we recycle() plastics, they will become microplastics sooner or later(). Recycling is not the answer to our problem. The better way is to use fewer plastic products().\n\n39.( )What is the main idea of the reading?\n(A)People can see microplastics clearly when they drink water.\n(B)Each one of us almost eat a plastic credit card every day.\n(C)We don’t need to recycle plastics because it is not useful to do so.\n(D)Microplastics are everywhere, and we should care about the problem.",

Luckily, there are a few easy tricks that can help you make friends. Most of the time, we show how we feel on our faces without knowing it. This means that if we’re feeling nervous, we’ll probably look that way, too. We should try to show our best side. For example, if we smile, people will think that we’re friendlier. Self-confidence is also important for making new friends. One of the best ways is to wear clothes that both show the real you and make you feel comfortable. Of course, you shouldn’t wear pajamas on your first day of school! Just be yourself—in your favorite clothes. If you don’t know how to talk with people you’ve just met, try asking them some questions about themselves. People usually enjoy talking about themselves. Ask the lady next to you how long she’s been at the company. Ask the guy behind you in class what his favorite subject is. It can take a while for deep friendships to form. Just enjoy the process of making friends.\n\n45.

Some people are like that; they like to feel scared, but why? Dr. Margee Kerr and her team have found the possible reason behind that. For years, Dr. Kerr has been studying the feeling of fear. To understand fear better, she has visited several haunted places. She also helped set up a haunted house on Halloween. More than 200 people bought tickets and agreed to be a part of the study. Dr. Kerr then studied those people’s feelings and brain activities before and after going into the haunted house. Although the haunted house was so scary that it made their hair stand on end, most people came out feeling happier and less tired. Dr. Margee Kerr and her team found out that getting scared is like doing exercise. It helps lower brain activities, so people can be less worried. The study also showed that being afraid can help put people in good mood.\n\n19. What is the reading mainly about?\nA. The fear of watching scary movies.\nB. Exciting scary movies for people to watch.\nC. The reasons behind people’s interests in being scared.\nD. The cause of people’s low brain activities when feeling scared.\n\n20.

Perhaps that is why Chinese have been using it for more than 4,000 years to treat all kinds of body problems. Today, scientists know that in green tea there are several substances good to health.\nFirst of all, catechin is helpful for cutting down on cancer. It protects the body from cancer‑causing substances and slows the growth of cholesterol levels and prevents serious health questions such as heart attacks and heart disease.\nSecond, caffeine makes the heart beat faster and the body more active. It was one thought that caffeine was not truly healthy, but studies say that there are some benefits to drinking caffeine. Among these studies, scientists have happily found that caffeine has something to do with a lower chance of getting Parkinson’s disease and liver disease. Yet, caffeine also has some side effects. It can make people too excited or angry easily, so doctors ask teenagers not to have more than one small cup of coffee a day.\nNext, vitamin C is important to humans, but the human body itself cannot make enough number. So we have to get it through food and drink. The vitamin has a hand in building up protection from colds and the flu. Besides, it helps get well from those diseases sooner.\nLast, theanine is another good substance found in tea. Scientists have shown that it can lower stress, both mind and body, and make thinking stronger. We can also use it for preventing Alzheimer’s disease.\nAs you can see, green tea has many great values. Drinking it may help you stay healthy. Of course, as with any healthy substance, it is important to check if there are any side effects as well.\n\n22. What is the passage mainly about?\nA. The use of green tea in Chinese medicine\nB. Reasons to drink green tea instead of coffee\nC. Some effects of drinking green tea\nD. Why scientists are interested in studying green tea\n\n23. The main purpose of the second paragraph is to\nA. talk about the side effects of catechin\nB. talk about the health benefits of catechin\nC. give the knowledge of the medical use of green tea\nD. give examples of some substances in green tea\n\n24. The words \"has a hand in\" in line 11 are closest in meaning to\nA. throws away\nB. hands in\nC. accepts\nD. takes part in\n\n25. Which is NOT true about caffeine?\nA. It helps prevent heart attacks and heart disease.\nB. It makes heart beat faster and excites humans.\nC. It lowers the chance of getting Parkinson’s disease and liver disease.\nD. People used to believe it was not very good for us.",

It has been a long tradition for the Japanese to make _____ _____ _____ _____ _____ cookies with eggs, butter, sugar, and flour. Around the 1900s, they began to put little notes in cookies to tell a person’s fortune. Since then, they have been a part of the food culture there. With this tradition in mind, Makoto Hagiwara started to make fortune cookies in the USA. Before the 1950s, bakers often made fortune cookies either with their hands or with chopsticks, so it took them a long time to make the cookies. That changed when Shuck Yee, a Chinese American, invented a machine to make the cookies faster. This made them popular at Chinese restaurants across the USA. Today, many Chinese restaurants in the USA serve fortune cookies at the end of a meal. They are well‑known not for their taste, but for their sayings. Here are some common fortunes:\n\n1. What makes fortune cookies popular?\n   (A) Their taste.\n   (B) Their color.\n   (C) Their shape.\n   (D) Their sayings.\n\n2.

From then on, Mr. Stubbs couldn’t swim or move like before. Life was hard for him. Without a tail, it was not easy for Mr. Stubbs to find food or live with other alligators.\nDr. Justin Georgi, an animal doctor, found Mr. Stubbs and lent him a hand. In 2013, Dr. Georgi used a special kind of material to make a new tail for Mr. Stubbs. With his new tail, Mr. Stubbs could swim and move like other alligators.\nBut as time went by, the old tail was too small for Mr. Stubbs. This time, Dr. Georgi studied Mr. Stubbs’ body and made another tail with a 3D printer. Mr. Stubbs can use this 3D tail for a long time. When this 3D tail is too small for him later, Dr. Georgi can just print a new one for him.\n\n33.

In 2021, a museum invited him to reproduce his early works for the museum’s collection. The museum wanted Haaning to show people's feelings about work in his production. Haaning didn't want to use paint or pencils. He wanted to use real money! Therefore, the museum lent Haaning money for his work. He got almost two and a half million Taiwan dollars!\n\nThen Haaning gave the museum his art. But it showed... nothing! Where was the money?! Haaning called his art \"Take the Money and Run\". And that's what he did! He took the money and ran! The museum put Haaning's all-white work in a show. But it wanted its money back, too. Haaning didn’t want to. He said taking the money was the art! This year, a judge said Haaning has to give the money back to the museum.\n\n8.

Which is true?\n(A) The museum presented an art without anything on it.\n(B) The Haaning’s work was filled with people.\n(C) The judge allowed Haaning not to give money back.\n(D) Haaning lost two and a half million NT dollars.",

    "chunk_text": "There were twin brothers named Eric and Ian. They looked the same, but they had different personalities. Eric always thought of the worst, but Ian always hoped for the best. Different meanings. One day, their parents decided to test them. They filled Eric’s room with toys, while they filled Ian’s room with horse manure.\n\nWhen they went to check on the boys, they found Eric sitting in the middle of his room, and crying. “What’s wrong?” they asked. “All these toys are great, but I know they’ll break or get old someday. Then I’ll have nothing.”\n\nWhen they went to Ian’s room, they found him digging the manure with a shovel excitedly. “What are you doing?” they asked. “With all the manure,” Ian replied, “there must be a pony somewhere in my room!”\n\nFor example, in American and European cultures, a thumbs‑up sign is a symbol of “well‑done.” In Brazil, they don’t use an “OK” gesture because they think it is not polite. So how do Brazilians say agree with a hand gesture? They will give you a thumbs‑up sign. However, in Egypt, a thumbs‑up sign has the same meaning as the Taiwanese middle finger standing alone, so it would be very rude if you do so.\n\nIn Germany, counting one starts with the thumb. So, if you need to order one cup of coffee in a German coffee shop, you need to show a thumb, not a pointer finger.\n\nNext time, before you take a trip, remember the words, “When in Rome, do as the Romans do.” Try to know more about each country’s special gestures, or using wrong gestures in wrong places will lead to lots of trouble.\n\n--- Questions ---\n\n( )56. What’s the reading mainly talking about?\nA. Toys may break someday.\nB. Toys may not be good for kids.\nC. Twins may have different personalities.\nD. Twins may look the same.\n\n( )51. What is the main idea of the reading?\nA. The role of hands in people’s lives.\nB. The way to order a cup of coffee.\nC. The meanings of a gesture in different countries.\nD. The differences between Germans and Brazilians.\n\n( )58. What did Ian get actually?\nA. A shovel.\nB. A pony.\nC. Manure.\nD. Toys.\n\n( )60. Which is NOT true in the reading?\nA. Eric and Ian have their own rooms.\nB. Eric and Ian are the same age.\nC. (option not provided in source)\nD. (option not provided in source)",

However, it has taken years for women to get the rights that they have now. Very few women studied in college 50 years ago, and most women didn’t have the right to vote until the middle of 20th century. Today, there are still many things that need to be worked on, such as parental leave, the pay gap, and so on.\nIceland is the model country for gender equality. At school, boys are not laughed at when they play with Barbie dolls or collect toys like Hello Kitty. Also, girls are encouraged to be strong and brave and become anything they want to be, even truck drivers and mechanics. Here people won’t doubt each other’s abilities because of gender. In 1980, Iceland also democratically elected the world’s first female president, Vigdís Finnbogadóttir. Today, 65% of its college students and 41% of its ministers are female. What’s more, each pair of parents receives nine month’s paid leave to take care of their baby.\nHowever, being as equal as it is, Iceland has a long way to go, for women still earn around 14% less than men. The government hopes to close the gender pay gap by 2022, and women’s group keep putting pressure on companies. After all, it’s not fair that women get less money just because they are female.\n\n( )30. When you “doubt” something, you it.\n(A) notice (B) show (C) question (D) believe\n\n( )31.

For example, the letters “BRB” mean “Be right back.” Also, people use some symbols to show how they feel. For example, they use the symbol of ☺ when they are happy. Lately, teenagers like to show their feelings by using some letters, like “T_T”. “T_T” means someone is crying. It is fun, isn’t it?

A word or a sentence reads the same from left to right or from right to left is called “palindrome”, e.g., “eye,” “Bob,” “my gym,” and “Was it a car or a cat I saw?” An anagram of a word or words is made by putting the letters of the word or words in a different way. Look at the words and their anagrams below. Can you think of other possible anagrams of these words?\n\nearth – heart\nbetween – been wet\nI eat – a tie\nmist – ake\n\nAnagrams are often longer words. They don’t really mean anything but are fun to say. Sometimes they can even mean something special, like when a common word, “restaurant,” becomes “Eat rats, run!”\n\nIn fact, palindromes and anagrams are more than just games. Palindromes can be used to learn mathematics and make music. Anagrams are also a good way to hide something. In history, people often hid their important studies in anagrams.
